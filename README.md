# txp-h5bp-theme: a replacement for Textpattern default theme

This project is designed as a replacement for the default theme that comes as standard with the Textpattern CMS. It is intended as a starting point for new users or existing users that want to adapt their current code and is not intended as a finished theme (though you could use it 'as is' if you want to).

## How to use these files

### CSS

#### /css/textpattern.css
You can either copy/paste the whole stylesheet into admin area > presentation > style > default, and link as:

    <txp:css format="link" />

or serve as an external stylesheet and link as (for example):

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/textpattern.css">

### Pages

#### /pages/archive.txp

This page template is utilised when viewing a list of articles.

Copy/paste over the existing page of the same name that was part of the standard Textpattern install.

#### /pages/default.txp
